          <h2>Attack</h2>
          <p>
            When taking this action, you make one melee or ranged spell attack.
            <br />
            First, pick a target within your weapon's range, a creature, an
            object, or a location. <br />
            Next, the GM determines additional modifiers, such as cover and
            advantage or disadvantage. <br />
            Finally, you make the attack roll. Roll a d20 and add your attack
            bonus, if the result is higher than the target's AC, the attack
            hits.
          </p>
          <h2>Cast a Spell</h2>
          <p>
            Certain characters and monsters have access to spells, which grant
            them unique actions. Every spell has it's own casting time, many of
            which are a single action, but there are spells that take minutes or
            even hours to cast.
          </p>
          <h2>Dash</h2>
          <p>
            Taking the Dash action allows characters to move up to their speed,
            including any modifiers or penalties that were applied to their
            original movement speed. Characters with a speed of 30 feet can dash
            and move 60 feet on their turn instead.
          </p>
          <h2>Disengage</h2>
          <p>
            When you take the disengage action, your movement no longer triggers
            opportunity attacks until the end of your next turn.
          </p>
          <h2>Dodge</h2>
          <p>
            Dodging causes all attack rolls made against you to be made with
            disadvantage, and you make Dexterity Saving Throws with advantage.
          </p>
          <h2>Help</h2>
          <p>
            You can take the help action to give another creature advantage on
            the next ability check it makes before the start of your next turn.
            <br />
            You can also aid an allied creature in making an attack roll if the
            target is within 5 feet of you and the attack is made before the
            start of your next turn.
          </p>
          <h2>Hide</h2>
          <p>
            When you take the hide action, you make a Dexterity(Stealth) check
            against the passive perceptions of nearby creatures. If you succeed,
            you are hidden from that creature and have advantage on the next
            attack roll you make against the creature. <br />
            You cannot take this action if the creature you are trying to hide
            from has line of sight to you.
          </p>
          <h2>Ready</h2>
          <p>
            You can take the Ready Action on your turn, which lets you act using
            your reaction before the start of your next turn. First, you pick a
            perceivable event that will act as the trigger for your action.
            Then, you define the action you will take when your trigger occurs,
            or you declare you will move up to your speed. When the trigger
            occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger
            finishes or ignore the trigger. When you ready a spell, you cast it
            as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction
            when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting
            time of 1 Action, and holding onto the spellâ€™s magic requires
            concentration. If your Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates
            without taking Effect.
          </p>
          <h2>Search</h2>
          <p>
            You make a Wisdom(Perception) check or an
            Intelligence(Investigation) check to find something that is hidden.
          </p>
          <h2>Use an Object</h2>
          <p>
            When an object specifies it requires an action to use, you take the
            Use an Object action.
          </p>
