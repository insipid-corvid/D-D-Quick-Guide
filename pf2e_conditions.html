            <h2>Blinded</h2>
            <p>
              You can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You
              can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically
              fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see, and if
              vision is your only precise sense, you take a –4 status penalty to
              Perception checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded
              overrides dazzled.
            </p>
            <h2>Broken</h2>
            <p>
              Broken is a condition that affects objects. An object is broken
              when damage has reduced its Hit Points to equal or less than its
              Broken Threshold. A broken object can't be used for its normal
              function, nor does it grant bonuses— with the exception of armor.
              Broken armor still grants its item bonus to AC, but it also
              imparts a status penalty to AC depending on its category: –1 for
              broken light armor, –2 for broken medium armor, or –3 for broken
              heavy armor.<br /><br />

              A broken item still imposes penalties and limitations normally
              incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing it. For example, broken
              armor would still impose its Dexterity modifier cap, check
              penalty, and so forth. <br /><br />

              If an effect makes an item broken automatically and the item has
              more HP than its Broken Threshold, that effect also reduces the
              item's current HP to the Broken Threshold.
