            <h2>Stats</h2>
            <p>
              When setting your character's stats, there are a few methods you
              can use, which sometimes vary from table to table. The most common
              methods are standard array, point buy, and rolling. Consult with
              your DM to find out which method you are expected to use.
            </p>
            <h3>Standard Array</h3>
            <p>
              When using standard array, you are given a pool of numbers to
              assign to any of your character's stats. The numbers available to
              choose from are 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8.<br><br><br>
              Example Wizard using Standard Array<br><br> 
              <span class="bolded">STR: 8, DEX: 13, CON: 14, INT: 15, WIS: 12, CHA: 10</span>
            </p>
            <h3>Point Buy</h3>
            <p>
              When using point buy, all of your character's stats start at 8,
              and you are given 27 points to increase them. Before racial
              bonuses, you can not increase any score above 15, or lower any
              score below 8.

              <table id="pointtable">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Ability Score</th>
                    <th>Point Cost</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>8</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>9</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>11</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>12</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>13</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>14</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>9</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>Example Wizard with Point Buy<br> <br>
                <span class="bolded">STR: 8 (0 points), DEX: 14 (7 points) CON: 14 (7 points), INT: 15 (9 points), WIS: 12 (4 points), CHA: 8 (0 points)</span>  <br><br> <span class="bolded">Total: 27 points</span></p>
            </p>
            <h3>Rolling</h3>
            <p>
              There are many different methods for rolling stats, but the most common methods are to roll 3d6 for each stat, or to roll 4d6 for each stat and ignore the lowest number. Generally stats are rolled during a session zero and should always be rolled in front of the GM. After the numbers are rolled, they are assigned the same way as standard array.
              <br> <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Race</h2>
            <p>When choosing a race for your character, it is often a good idea to consider which races provide the most benefits for your class.
              Each race provides bonuses to specific ability scores which can help push your primary stats higher. The optional Tasha's Cauldron of Everything
              variant rule allows you to reassign those ability scores to any stat you wish, but not every table uses those rules, so consult with the GM first.
            </p>
            <h3>Common Races</h3>
            <h4>Dragonborn</h4>
            <p>Having boosts to Strength and Charisma makes Dragonborn perfect to be paladins. They also are well-suited to be fighters, barbarians, and even some bards (Valor/Swords college).
              The breath weapon gives an area of effect option to classes which do not have them, and you gain a damage resistance to the type of damage your breath weapon deals, making you more resilient.
              Chromatic dragonborn can become immune to that damage for a minute which is particularily effective for red and green dragonborn, metallic dragonborn gain some powerful alternative breath weapon options,
              and gem dragonborn gain telepathy and limited flight abilties.
            </p>
            <h4>Dwarf</h4>
            <h4>Elf</h4>
            <h4>Gnome</h4>
            <h4>Half-Elf</h4>
            <h4>Half-Orc</h4>
            <h4>Halfling</h4>
            <h4>Human</h4>
            <h4>Tiefling</h4>
