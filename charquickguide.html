            <h2>Stats</h2>
            <p>
              When setting your character's stats, there are a few methods you
              can use, which sometimes vary from table to table. The most common
              methods are standard array, point buy, and rolling. Consult with
              your DM to find out which method you are expected to use.
            </p>
            <h3>Standard Array</h3>
            <p>
              When using standard array, you are given a pool of numbers to
              assign to any of your character's stats. The numbers available to
              choose from are 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8.<br><br><br>
              Example Wizard using Standard Array<br><br> 
              <p class="bolded">STR: 8, DEX: 13, CON: 14, INT: 15, WIS: 12, CHA: 10</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Point Buy</h3>
            <p>
              When using point buy, all of your character's stats start at 8,
              and you are given 27 points to increase them. Before racial
              bonuses, you can not increase any score above 15, or lower any
              score below 8.

              <table id="pointtable">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Ability Score</th>
                    <th>Point Cost</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>8</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>9</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>11</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>12</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>13</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>14</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>9</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>Example Wizard with Point Buy<br> <br>
                <p class="bolded">STR: 8 (0 points), DEX: 14 (7 points) CON: 14 (7 points), INT: 15 (9 points), WIS: 12 (4 points), CHA: 8 (0 points)</span>  <br><br> <p class="bolded">Total: 27 points</p></p>
            </p>
            <h3>Rolling</h3>
            <p>
              There are many different methods for rolling stats, but the most common methods are to roll 3d6 for each stat, or to roll 4d6 for each stat and ignore the lowest number. Generally stats are rolled during a session zero and should always be rolled in front of the GM. After the numbers are rolled, they are assigned the same way as standard array.
              <br> <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Lineage</h2>
            <p>When choosing a lineage for your character, it is often a good idea to consider which lineages provide the most benefits for your class.
              Each lineage provides bonuses to specific ability scores which can help push your primary stats higher. The optional Tasha's Cauldron of Everything
              variant rule allows you to reassign those ability scores to any stat you wish, but not every table uses those rules, so consult with the GM first.
            </p>

            <h4>Dragonborn</h4>
            <p>Having boosts to Strength and Charisma makes Dragonborn perfect to be paladins. They also are well-suited to be fighters, barbarians, and even some bards (Valor/Swords college).
              The breath weapon gives an area of effect option to classes which do not have them, and they gain a damage resistance to the type of damage your breath weapon deals, making you more resilient.
            </p>

            <h4>Dwarf</h4>
            <p>Dwarves are slightly slower than the standard medium races, but they have plenty of features to make up for it. Dwarves gain a Constitution boost, they have darkvision to see better in the dark,
               they are more resilient against poison, and they get proficiency with some useful martial weapons that some classes lack. They also have multiple subraces which further
               augment their ability to succeed as certain classes.</p>
            <h5>Hill Dwarf</h5>
              <p>Hill dwarves are sturdier than most other lineages, as they gain an extra hit point for every level they have. They also get a small Wisdom boost, which can help with Wisdom saving throws.
                Hill dwarves are effective as nearly any class as their bonuses are useful in most circumstances, but they will rarely be the best option.
              </p>
            <h5>Mountain Dwarf</h5>
              <p>Mountain dwarves gain access to light and medium armor and are one of the only lineages to gain +4 total ability scores instead of +3. The Strength boost makes them effective
                as martial classes such as fighters and barbarians, but the armor proficiency makes them one of the most attractive options for spellcasters, as it lets them fix their normally low
                AC without spending a spell every day for mage armor. If you are using the Tasha's variant ability scores, they are one of the best spellcaster lineages in the game.
              </p>

            <h4>Elf</h4>
            <p>Elves gain a boost to Dexterity, which is beneficial for nearly every class in the game. They have darkvision to see better in the dark, are harder to charm, and can't be put to sleep
              by magic. Elves gain proficiency in perception, which is usually the best skill in the game, and can complete a long rest in four hours rather than the eight that other lineages need.
            </p>

            <h5>Dark Elf</h5>
            <p>Dark elves gain their secondary boost in Charisma, which when coupled with the Dexterity boost of the base elf, makes them effective bards, Dexterity paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks.
              Dark elves also have the longest darkvision range of any lineage, but it comes paired with sunlight sensitivity which makes it harder to make attack rolls and perception checks in direct sunlight.
              They also have access to three useful spells, and are trained in some of the best Dexterity based weapons in the game.
            </p>
            <h5>High Elf</h5>
            <p>High elves get their secondary boost in Intelligence, which makes them perfect wizards and artificers, as well as arcane trickster rogues. They get a free wizard cantrip, which is good for grabbing an extra cantrip
               on a spellcaster or adding a bit of spice to a martial. Elves are also trained in longswords, shortswords, longbows, and shortbows, with the longbow proficiency being incredible for rogues.
            </p>
            <h5>Wood Elf</h5>
            <p>Wood elves have a Wisdom boost, making them excellent druids and rangers. The weapon proficiencies are the same as the high elf, which is good for spellcasters and the rogue. Wood elves are one of the fastest lineages 
              with a speed of 35 feet, which is useful for nearly every class, and makes up for their lackluster Mask of the Wild feature that lets them hide when lightly obscured.
            </p>

            <h4>Gnome</h4>
            <p>Gnomes are one of the few small races in fifth edition, meaning they only have a 25 foot speed. They have darkvision, and they also have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves 
              against magic, making them extremely resilient to the most dangerous spells. Gnomes get their large ability boost in Intelligence, making them good wizards and artificers.
            </p>
            <h5>Forest Gnome</h5>
            <p>Forest gnomes get a boost in Dexterity, which is useful for wizards and artificers as they do not usually have heavy armor, except for the armorer artificer. They also get minor illusion which is a fantastic 
              cantrip for anyone, as long as the GM is willing to play along. Forest gnomes can also communicate with small animals, which can be situationally useful for scouting or fetching small items.
            </p>
            <h5>Rock Gnome</h5>
            <p>Rock gnomes get a boost in Constitution, which is useful on any class, but they are still somewhat shoehorned into being Intelligence based classes, as they get bonuses
              to history checks. They also can make small contraptions which functionally fill a similar role to utility cantrips, making them useful in the right circumstances.
            </p>

            <h4>Half-Elf</h4>
            <p>Half-Elves are one of the most versatile lineages in the game, with a boost to charisma and two small boosts to any other stats, they have more stat boosts than most other lineages.
              They have darkvision and the elf resistance to charm effects and immunity to magical sleep, and they also get to choose one trait from the elf subraces, or proficiency in two skills, 
              with both options being incredibly powerful. Half-Elves tend towards Charisma classes such as bard, paladin, sorcerer, and warlock, but they are effective in any class they decide to 
              become, due to their incredible versatility.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Half-Orc</h4>
            <p>Half-Orcs get boosts to both Strength and Constitution, making them excellent as martial classes. They are proficient in intimidation, can resist going unconscious once a day,
               and do extra damage when they critically hit with a melee weapon. Half-Orcs do best as barbarians and fighters, but they can also be effective paladins, clerics, and any other 
               class that expects to fight in melee range.
            </p>

            <h4>Halfling</h4>
            <p>Halflings are another small lineage, with a speed of 25 feet, but they have one of the best racial features in the game. If a halfling rolls a 1 on the dice, they can roll again one time, 
              after which they have to take the result. This is especially helpful on characters that expect to make a lot of attack rolls or skill checks. Halflings are also hard to frighten, 
            and can move through the space of larger creatures which can be very helpful if they are being cornered. Halflings make effective rogues and rangers due to the Dexterity bonus they get,
          and can also make good fighters and paladins.</p>
              <h5>Lightfoot</h5>
              <p>Lightfoot halflings lean into the roguish nature of halflings, as they can hide behind creatures larger than them, which is usually most of their party, giving them many extra places
                to hide.
              </p>
              <h5>Stout</h5>
              <p>Stout halflings are strong martial characters, as they get a bonus to Constitution and resistance to poison, which makes them harder to take down.</p>
            <h4>Human</h4>
            <p>Humans are a very simple lineage but also a very strong one. The basic human gets a +1 to every ability score, which allows for some very high stats at level 1. 
              Variant humans are one of the most versatile races, as they replace the +1 to every ability score with a +1 to two scores, they get proficiency in one skill of their choice, 
              and they get to pick a feat. Both types of human are effective as any class and have no issues filling any role.
            </p>
            <h4>Tiefling</h4>
            <p>Tieflings have a Charisma boost, leaning them towards bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks. They have darkvision, and also resist fire damage which is one of the 
              most common types of damage. </p>

              <h5>Tiefling Variants</h5>
              <p>With Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes and the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, they are many different variants on tiefling which can allow them to fill any role in a party.</p>
